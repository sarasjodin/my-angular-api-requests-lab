## More about This Project

This is a frontend web application built with Angular that displays a structured list of academic courses.
Each course entry includes its course code, name, progression level (A‚ÄìC), and a link to the official syllabus.

The application is styled using custom CSS and is fully responsive, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
Developed as part of a frontend development course, it functions as a digital CV or course portfolio, showcasing the developer‚Äôs academic background.

Course data is stored locally (or fetched via JSON) and rendered dynamically using Angular‚Äôs component-based architecture.
The app is fully translated into English. If a course name changes in the future, the Swedish name will be displayed until a manual translation is added.
