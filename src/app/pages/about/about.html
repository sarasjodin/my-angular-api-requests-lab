  <h2>About this site</h2>
  <p>
    This site is part of a frontend development lab focused on Angular 20, RxJS,
    and working with external data sources.
  </p>
  <p>
    The application fetches a course schedule (ramschema) from an external API.
    If the remote source is unavailable, it automatically falls back to a local
    JSON file stored in the public folder.
  </p>
  <p>It demonstrates several core Angular concepts including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Standalone components</li>
    <li>HTTP requests using HttpClient with RxJS</li>
    <li>Data binding with signals</li>
    <li>Filtering and sorting in real-time</li>
    <li>Responsive table layout with accessibility in mind</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The table view allows users to search for courses by name or code, sort by
    any column (ascending, descending, or reset), and view syllabus links for
    each course.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project is fully version-controlled with Git, hosted on GitHub, and
    published on a public web host. Styling is done using SCSS at both component
    and global levels.

  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a developer with a long-time interest in modern fullstack web
    development. This project gave me hands-on experience with Angular’s
    reactive data flow using signals, real-time data binding, and error-handling
    strategies with RxJS.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also explored standalone component architecture, service-based API
    integration, and fallback logic. The implementation
    of sorting and filtering on live data helped reinforce my understanding of
    state management within Angular applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through this lab, I gained deeper insight into building maintainable and
    user-friendly interfaces while keeping performance and responsiveness in
    mind.
