    <h2>About this site</h2>
    <p>
      This site is part of a frontend development lab focused on Angular 20,
      RxJS, and working with external data sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      The application fetches a course schedule from an external API. If the
      remote source is unavailable, it automatically falls back to a local JSON
      file stored in the public folder. Course names are translated via the
      local JSON to improve accessibility for international users.
    </p>
    <p>It demonstrates several core Angular concepts including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Standalone components</li>
      <li>HTTP requests using HttpClient with RxJS</li>
      <li>Data binding with classic Angular techniques</li>
      <li>Filtering and sorting in real-time</li>
      <li>Responsive table layout with accessibility in mind</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The table view allows users to search for courses by name or code, sort by
      any column (ascending, descending, or reset), and view syllabus links for
      each course.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project is fully version-controlled with Git, hosted on GitHub, and
      published on a public web host. Styling is done using SCSS at both
      component and global levels.

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a developer with a long-time interest in modern fullstack web
      development. This project gave me hands-on experience with Angularâ€™s
      reactive data flow, real-time data binding, and error-handling strategies
      with RxJS.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also explored standalone component architecture, service-based API
      integration, and fallback logic. The implementation of sorting and
      filtering on live data helped reinforce my understanding of state
      management within Angular applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this lab, I gained deeper insight into building maintainable and
      user-friendly interfaces while keeping performance and responsiveness in
      mind.
