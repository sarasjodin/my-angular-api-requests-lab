<h2>Course list</h2>
<!-- This is a two-way data binding input field
 Binds the input field to a property named filterValue in the component
 When the user types the value is updated in real time
 applyFilter gets called every time the user types something-->
<input [(ngModel)]="filterValue" (input)="applyFilter()" />

<!-- A reusable app-course-table with the following content:
Passes a filtered list of courses (filteredCourses) into the table
Tell the table how the data is currently being sorted (by column and direction)
The table component can emit a sortRequest event, when a column header is clicked
The parent listens to this and runs onSort($event) -->
<app-course-table
  [courses]="filteredCourses"
  [sortKey]="sortKey"
  [sortDirection]="sortDirection"
  (sortRequest)="onSort($event)"
></app-course-table>
